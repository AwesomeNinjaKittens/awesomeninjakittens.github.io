##Who are we?
We are a bunch of developers who wants to make the world a better place and have fun while doing it, which makes us try new fun things when it comes to developing stuff. :)
##Good to know..
Right now we are using Bitbucket a bit more, but we might move over some open source projects to GitHub in the future. At current we are working much on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> integrations with popular web-technologies aswell as integrating towards iOS applications and JAVA based stuff :).

Our official home is current at https://bitbucket.org/awesomeninjakittens/ go check it out :)
Or come chat with us @ https://www.hipchat.com/gM1vjB8Yk
Finally our GitHub place could/should first be reached through https://awesomeninjakittens.github.io
